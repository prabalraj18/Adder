# Adder
This repository contains Verilog implementations and testbenches for various types of adders, ranging from basic to advanced designs. Each adder is verified using testbenches and follows a structured approach to digital circuit design.

# Content 
Basic Adders 
1. Half adder
2. Full adder
3. Ripple carry adder
   
Intermediate Adders 
1. Carry Look-Ahead adder
2. Carry Save adder

Parallel Prefix Adder
1. Brent-Kung adder
2. Kogge-Stone adder
3. Skalanksy adder


# Running the Adders 
Before running the adders, ensure that you have installed:

1.Icarus Verilog (for compilation and simulation)  
2.GTKWave (for waveform analysis)

If not installed, follow the setup instructions from the [Verilog-env-setup Repository](https://github.com/prabalraj18/Verilog-env-setup) repository.
